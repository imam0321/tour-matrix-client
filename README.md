# Tour Matrix Fullstack Project

**Tour Matrix** is a full-stack travel and tour booking platform built entirely with **TypeScript**. It offers secure, role-based dashboards for **Users, Guides, Admins, and Super Admins**, ensuring that each type of user has access to the features they need.

The frontend is developed using **React.js with TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **RTK Query** for efficient state management and seamless API communication. The backend is powered by **Node.js/Express with TypeScript**, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **JWT-based authentication** for secure login and role management.

This platform simulates a real-world travel booking ecosystem, providing features like:
- Tour listings  
- Booking management  
- Secure payments  
- Comprehensive administrative controls  

All designed to deliver a smooth and reliable experience for travelers and administrators alike.
